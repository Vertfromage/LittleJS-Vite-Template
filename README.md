# React + Vite + Tailwind + LittleJS

This is a template for setting up a React project using Vite and Tailwind and then making a LittleJS game component that will run in the app. 

# Setup
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

# LittleJS
- Find the game code in src\game
- To use component import component and use like:
```
 <LittleGame/> 
```
- Put global variables/functions in GameManager and import where needed 
- Make objects in gameObjects
- import the littleJS module and destructure all functions/properties that you need

# Current Bugs
- I have the example pong project running, but it's zoomed in too much
